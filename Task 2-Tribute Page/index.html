					<p>Paul Walker was an incredibly talented actor and a kind-hearted individual who left a lasting
						impact on the world. He was best known for his role as Brian O'Conner in the Fast & Furious
						franchise, but his contributions to the film industry and his philanthropic efforts extend far
						beyond that.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="colab">
					<img src="Assets/paul.jpg" alt="">
					<p>Walker's love for cars and speed was well-known, and he brought that passion to life on the big
						screen in the Fast & Furious series. But off-screen, he was equally passionate about giving back
						to
						his community and helping those in need. He founded Reach Out Worldwide (ROWW), a nonprofit
						organization that provides aid to those affected by natural disasters, and he was actively
						involved
						in its efforts until his untimely passing in 2013.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="colab">
					<img src="Assets/paul with vin.jpg" alt="">
					<p>Walker's legacy continues to live on through his films, his charitable work, and the countless
						lives
						he touched. He will always be remembered as a true icon of the film industry and a shining
						example
						of what it means to use one's platform for good.</p>
